# Kernel Wishlist

1. Remove the need for `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` to use [`linkat(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/linkat.2.html) with `AT_EMPTY_PATH`. You can already get this functionality in a less-clean way by using `/proc/self/fd/#` and `AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW` instead of `AT_EMPTY_PATH` without that permission. If you deliberately unmount `/proc` to make this impossible, then just use seccomp-bpf, SELinux, or something to block this instead of insisting that it be blocked for everyone by default. This was briefly done in [torvalds/linux@`bb2314b`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bb2314b), but was then undone in [torvalds/linux@`f0cc6ff`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f0cc6ff). The latter commit message said "we're still busily discussing the exact details of this all, so I'm going to revert it for now" and "We may re-do this ... once the whole discussion about the interface is done.", but I can find no further discussion about this.
